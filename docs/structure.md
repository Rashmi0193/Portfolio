What App.jsx is
What components are
Why you separated UI into Navbar, Hero, ProjectCard, etc.

# Project Structure

## App.jsx
- `App.jsx` is the root React component for the portfolio.
- It defines the overall page layout and renders all sections.

## Components
The UI is broken into reusable components such as:
- Navbar
- Hero section
- Project cards
- Experience items
- Buttons and pills

This makes the code easier to read, reuse, and maintain.

## Styling
- Tailwind CSS utility classes are used directly inside JSX.
- Smooth scrolling is enabled via CSS for better navigation experience.
